# Handwritten equation solver  

## App state
*The app is still under development*

At this state app can properly detect and recognize all handwritten numbers in a given photo.

## The algorithm

The result is achieved applying machine learning techniques for image analysis, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

Digit detection is implemented using image filtering and manipulation algorithms from OpenCV library.
